# TODO

### CSP:

- Room tags -> apply CSP (random?) template

#### Variables

- Auto margin box
- Variable structures (eg, 3 objects anywhere in bounding box, cellular?)
- Select appropriate structure from list (eg. sconce/wall deco structure that fits/aligns)

#### Constraints

- Parameters - eg. place x within min/max distance of y

## Soon

- Better ledge/shadow support
- Player/NPC abilities (especially w/ visual effects)
- Basic combat
- Basic inventory
- ECS debug dialog - demonstrate ECS with interface to change entity components live

### Region/Overseer

- Usability/consistency pass
- Standardise API-like query results

### ECS

- Usability/consistency pass (esp. Systems)
- Reduce System boilerplate - pass in object with common requirements (local, currentActing etc.)
- Automatic mapping of template data to correct component without hardcoding (if possible)
- Basic AI module

## Someday

- Add more beings
- Describe entity color for messages
- Spatial indexing of entities? (ECS - automate marking cells as dirty re: render data)
- Memoize cell render data
- Exception handling
- (W)alk/autoexplore
- Viewport doesn't move until you are closer to the side
- Dev/Prod Configs

## Maybe

- vignette/player position effects luminance level wide
- level: voronoi map - bee hive/crystal cavern
- Level: create walkable pt list during generate for spawning
- Patch ROT.JS to handle drawOver tiles?
- Test ROT-JS patch, submit PR
- light bleeds slightly into void?
- Switch main rendering engine (PIXI?)

# Known Bugs

- Rooms doesn't reliably connect all rooms
- Sprites occasionally randomly disappear for a frame (?)
