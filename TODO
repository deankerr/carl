# TODO

## Now

## Soon

- Standardize entity template definitions (move beings/features to Templates)
- Lighting effects (torches/decreasing light from player)
- Config 'lightsOn' player FOV per level (ie lightson/large fov outdoors, lightsoff lesser fov in dungeon). Better debug controls
- vignette/player position effects luminance level wide
- Add more decoration terrain/items/void decor - reeds
- Add simple animation (npc bobbing)/ Render decouple
- stairs to Prefab ruin1 above outdoor, render outdoor "below"
- Create logger, Exception handling

- Domains: generate levels with "set piece" connectors, or auto depth stairs. Component on connector describes where it leads
- Refactor Level, generators to properly support domain switching/implement domain connection schema
- Test ROT-JS patch, submit PR

- Level: create walkable pt list during generate for spawning
- render: move to key + lookup table, allow easier pallette switching.
