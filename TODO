# TILESET

- Simplify render components -> set a default visible/seen, stop doing a giant deciscion tree every render
- Unify render attribute between all entities/terrain/etc.
- new Render function (decoupling?)
- Add decoration terrain/items
- Import prefab

## Later

- Larger TS levels + Viewport
- Enable view selection + live switching
- Lighting effects (torches/decreasing light from player)
- (light bleeds slightly into void? )
- Add simple animation (npc bobbing)/ Render decouple

# TODO

- Clarify State functionality, logging
- Unify function declaration style
- Refactor Generate to improvement corridor placement, flexibility, visualizer integration into Game, entity generation
- Move TerrainDictionary into Level
- Split Components into own files
- ?xxx Refactor world.here() result from tuple to object for better clarity
- Create logger, Exception handling
- Something like world.query().entitiesWith('position', 'tagWalkable').optionally('door').without('tagPlayer').at({x: 1, y: 2})
- Teleport player to mouse click
- Messages get dimmer as they age, use ROT.Text.measure to clip instead of dummy display
- Move Messages into different ROT.Display with different font
- Localestorage random seed saving, easily travel backwards throguh previously generated levels
- ? Strip Level down to data structure, move terrain info methods to World(?), level gen initition to genereate/world
- Move player "seen" tracking to level
