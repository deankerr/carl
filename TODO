# TODO

## Now

- localStorage saves debug/init options so I don't have to keep changing the config file
- Define world structure/level connections. (Debug - fast level switching with num keys)

## Soon

- Lighting effects (torches/decreasing light from player)
- Config 'lightsOn' player FOV per level (ie lightson/large fov outdoors, lightsoff lesser fov in dungeon). Better debug controls
- vignette/player position effects luminance level wide
- Add more decoration terrain/items/void decor - reeds
- Add simple animation (npc bobbing)/ Render decouple
- stairs to Prefab ruin1 above outdoor, render outdoor "below"
- Create logger, Exception handling

## Someday

- Test ROT-JS patch, submit PR
- Level: create walkable pt list during generate for spawning
- ? rename World to Engine, "world" describes level/dungeon connections, globals. messageLog
- render: move to key + lookup table, allow easier pallette switching.
- Async update loop
- Improve State/World init (remove state active?), World level switching/creation
- (W)alk/autoexplore
- ??? Patch ROT.JS to handle drawOver tiles? ???

- ?Local storage random seed saving, easily travel backwards through previously generated levels
- Clean up CONFIG
- Viewport doesn't move until you are closer to the side
- Dev/Prod Configs
- ?tagCurrentTurn/acting components redundant
- enemy: chuckler, beetle, horsefly
- level: voronoi map - bee hive/crystal cavern
